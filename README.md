# Rebel Engine
Basic engine created for academic reasons for the UPC' s Talent School Master Degree in Advanced Programming for AAA Videogames.
## Features

 - 3D Scene view with Unity-like controls
 - Loading 3D models into the scene by dragging and dropping files
	 - For now, one 3D model at a time
 - Console log
 - Configuration window
 - Inspector window

## Additional features
- Rendering the scene into framebuffers to, lately, show it inside a ImGui window.

## How to use

### Loading a 3D Model and textures

Simply drag and drop the desired file into the application. <span id="a1">[[1]](#f1)</span>. <span id="a2">[[2]](#f2)</span>.

### Inspector

This window displays read-only information about the loaded mesh. We have:

- Transform
- Geometry
- Textures

### Terminal
This window shows us all the logs generated by the application. We can copy all the log shown in the clipboard, as well as delete all the log buffer. You can filter through a text input, but also the LOG's have a type assigned that you can filter through them. <span id="a3">[[3]](#f3)</span>.

### Configuration

#### Application

In this window we can visualize two histograms about the evolution of the frame rate of the application. We can also activate or deactivate VSYNC.

#### Window

In this window we can modify the size of the window, as well as activate or deactivate the full screen mode.

#### Render

In this window we can activate or deactivate some OpenGL options. <span id="a4">[[4]](#f4)</span>. Also modify the clear color.

#### Texture
In this window we can change the minification and magnification functions used when the size of a text does not correspond to that of a pixel.

#### Hardware information

In this window we can see information related to the CPU and GPU.<span id="a5">[[5]](#f5)</span>.
